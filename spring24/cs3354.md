1. Compare the average score between round 1 and 2; explain why score for round 2 is higher.
Since the developer team can choose the order in which which to place the pieces, they can place them on the board in a more optimal way. This is why in round 2, when the team received 5 pieces to choose from in advance, the score was higher. This has parallels to the concept of prioritization in sprint and product planning.

2. How did you feel about the game in the second round?
We felt more in control, more productive, and had more opportunity to coordinate.

3. What are the similarities between the second round and scrum (a. dev team, b. product owner, c. product backlog, d. sprint backlog, e. sprint, f. team velocity).

a. The developer team is responsible for responding to issues as they arrive; this is akin to the group of people responsible for receiving the legos and then figuring out how to place them on the board in the optimal way.

b. The product owner is responsible for defining and prioritizing the product backlog; this is similar the part of the assignment where the team organized the sequence and orientation of pieces to give to the opposing team. 

c. The product backlog is a dynamic, prioritized list of features, enhancements, and bug fixes required to deliver the product; this is akin to the pre-planned sequence of legos given to the opposing team.

d. The sprint backlog is like the product backlog, but on a smaller more actionable scale; this is, also, akin to the pre-planned sequence of legos given to the opposing team.

e. The sprint is a unit of time, typically lasting two to four weeks, during which a development team works to deliver a potentially releasable product increment; this is akin to part of the assignment where the team received the legos and then decided how to place them on the board in the most optimal way. 

f. Team velocity is a measure of the amount of work a development team can complete in a sprint, usually expressed as a sum of "story points" or other agreed-upon units of effort associated with task completion during a sprint; this is akin to the number of stubs covered on the board.
