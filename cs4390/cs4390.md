# Networks: Exam 1

### 2024-01-31: [HW01 help], [ch 1.4.1] 
HW01 calculations and introduction to OSI model layers. Bits are transmitted between computers as electric signals on wires or wirelessly as EM waves through the air.

### 2024-01-31: [ch 1.4.2 - 1.4.6], [ch 2.2.3 or 1.5 (idk)]
Finish discussing OSI layers and then cover TCP/IP layers. TCP/IP is the protocol most used in practice and OSI is the underlying fundamental protocol theory.

### 2024-02-05: [ch 4.2 - 4.3], [ch 1.6.2], [ch 3.5]
Ethernet has transmission issues [4.2]. There is a dichotomy of networks, connectionless vs. connection-oriented, each has tradeoffs. Async data transfer solved a lot of problems in the data-link layer (needs elaboration), and is a key example of connection-oriented (in contrast to IP) [3.5].

the first function of the datalink layer is framing, the second is error control.


# byte stuffing
insert an escape for every escape and flag byte, flag bytes without a preceding escape are interpreted by the receiver as the beginning and end of a frame

> what is byte stuffing

# problem with byte stuffing
byte stuffing fails when characters (bytes) are encoded with 16 bits (unicode)

# bit stuffing 
the more portable version of byte stuffing

0111 1110 == flag (beginning of frame)
sender inserts a 0 after sequences of 5 bits, preventing sequences of 6 1's (potential flags)
receiver removes the 0 after each sequence of 5 ones, because assume the sender inserted

# physical (manchester) encoding
encode information at the physical layer in transitions between high to low voltage, where 1 is represented high --> low, and 0 is represented low --> high; frames are represented as high-high low-low pairs.

the receiver is expecting high to low transitions as it's receiving each physical bit; when it doesn't, it knows it has encountered a new frame. also called "the data includes the clock".

more rapidly changing data requires larger bandwidth, and this method requires twice the bandwidth.

# error detection
there are two types of errors, single-bit and clusters of bits (called bursts).

regions of errors in bits are called bursts. it's a technical challenge to rigorously define where a burst starts and ends (to define the length of a burst).

> what are the two types of data link errors

# code word error correction (not detection)
correcting errors on the receiving end; in contrast to not sending an acknowledgment to resend all of the data.

you want to send the bit 1, instead send 8x 1 bits; an error would look like 1110 1001 (some of the bits are flipped). but since most of the bits are 1, assume what was intended to be sent was 1. this is called "adding redundancy".

the "code word" is the original message with redundant bits added.

the "hamming distance" is the number of errors in transmission comparison to the code word sent; or more precisely, the xor of the message sent (the code word) and the message received. 

> what is a code word
> how do you get the hamming distance

# error correction and detection, hamming distance
there's a point where a code word (message) can have so many error bits that it's interpreted as another code word. there are some formulas and calculations associated with this idea.

> how many bit errors can a code word of hamming distance d + 1 detect
> how many bit errors can a code word of hamming distance 2d + 1 correct

code words		one error
000				100 010 001		one error
011
110
101
any 1 error can be detected, but if there are 2 errors: the code word will be interpreted as another code word.

tells you how many errors

> how many bits are required to correct a single (1) bit error
m + r + 1 < 2^r
