# Networks: Exam 1

### 2024-01-31: [HW01 help], [ch 1.4.1] 
HW01 calculations and introduction to OSI model layers. Bits are transmitted between computers as electric signals on wires or wirelessly as EM waves through the air.

### 2024-01-31: [ch 1.4.2 - 1.4.6], [ch 2.2.3 or 1.5 (idk)]
Finish discussing OSI layers and then cover TCP/IP layers. TCP/IP is the protocol most used in practice and OSI is the underlying fundamental protocol theory.

### 2024-02-05: [ch 4.2 - 4.3], [ch 1.6.2], [ch 3.5]
Ethernet has transmission issues [4.2]. There is a dichotomy of networks, connectionless vs. connection-oriented, each has tradeoffs. Async data transfer solved a lot of problems in the data-link layer (need to elaborate on this), and is a key example of connection-oriented (in contrast to IP) [3.5].

### 2024-02-07: [finish slides 1]
** Hidden terminal problem. Begin study of the physical layer.
