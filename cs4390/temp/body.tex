\section{Data rate problem}
It is desired to send a sequence of computer screen images over optical fiber. The screen is 3840 $\times$ 2160 pixels, each pixel being 24 bits. There are 60 screen images per second. What data rate is needed?

\begin{align*}
	\text{Data Rate} = \frac{\text{Number of bits}}{\text{Bits per second}}
\end{align*}

To find the bits per second quantity, first calculate the number of bits in an image. There are $24 \text{ bits} \cdot (3840 \times 2160)$ = 199,065,600 bits per image. 

There are 60 of these images being transmitted per second, therefore the data rate is $60 \cdot 199,065,600 = 1.194 \cdot 10^{10}$.
