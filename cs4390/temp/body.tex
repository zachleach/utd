\section{Data rate problem}
It is desired to send a sequence of computer screen images over optical fiber. The screen is 3840 $\times$ 2160 pixels, each pixel being 24 bits. There are 60 screen images per second. What data rate is needed?

\begin{align*}
	\text{Data Rate} = \frac{\text{Number of bits}}{\text{Bits per second}}
\end{align*}

In this case, the solution is
