# problem 1
- data rate

how do you calculate data rate

### data rate = bits / time

# problem 2
- fdm multiplexing
- guard bands

what is FDM
what are guard bands
how do guard bands effect minimum bandwidth required for an FDM multiplixed channel
how do you calculate bandwidth of a channel

### bandwidth = [# channels \cdot channel bandwidth] + [(# channels - 1) \cdot guardband width]

# problem 3
- analog signal sampling
- data rate
- quantization levels

what is analog signal sampling
what are quantization levels
how do you calculate data rate required by a sampled signal

### data rate = 2 \cdot analog signal bandwidth \cdot quantization number
 
# problem 4
- central switch star topology
- bidirectional ring
- fully interconnected
- transmission path hopes

what are transmission path hops
what is central switch star topology
what is bidirectional ring topology
what is fully interconnected topology

### star best: 
### star average: 
### star worst: 

### bidirectional best: 
### bidirectional average:
### bidirectional worst:

### fully interconnected best:
### fully interconnected average:
### fully interconnected worst:

# problem 5
- copper twisted pairs
- calculate price 

what is a twisted pair wire

### volume = \pi r^2 h
### mass = volume \cdot density
### price = mass \cdot price per kg

# problem 6
- downstream bandwidth
- cable selection

what is downstream bandwidth

### total bandwidth = # houses \cdot guaranteed bandwidth per house (for FDM)
### the cable needs to provide this total bandwidth via some form of multiplexing

# problem 7
- geo, meo, leo satellites
- calculate end-to-end transit time

what is end-to-end transit
how do you calculate packet transit time for satellites

### round trip delay = [2 \cdot distance]  / [speed of light]
