*recursion tree* ?
	*cost* of a subproblem?
	*subproblem* ?


tree
costs
subproblems
levels

there are levels, with costs; the sum of each level cost represents the cost of the recursive function.

generating a guess (which you can verify later on).

how to calculate the depth of tree
	the `log_{denominator}` of the recursive term

what is a "tight" bound

how to use substitution method to verify a recurrence

	write out the worked examples from 4.4
	work out some of the exercises from 4.4
