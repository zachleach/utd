\section*{\Huge\bfseries Chapter 1}

\section{What is an algorithm}
An algorithm is a sequence of computational steps that transforms an input into an output, generally to solve a well-defined computational problem.

\section{What is a data structure}
Data structures are a way to store and organize data in memory to facilitate efficient access and modification (e.g., to enhance the speed of an algorithm).

\section{How to quantitatively measure algorithm efficiency}
Intuitively, it takes $c$ units of time to perform a given computational operation. Typically the number of operations required by an algorithm corresponds to the size of the input $n$; therefore, algorithmic efficiency is expressed as a function of input size. 

For instance, to sort $n$ integers in increasing order, the \ii{insertion sort} algorithm takes $c \cdot n^2$ units time, whereas the \ii{merge sort} takes $c \cdot n \lg n$. Comparably speaking then, the $n \lg n$ algorithm will outperform the $n^2$ algorithm for large input sizes $n$. 

There's an entire mathematical notation for identifying and comparing these input-efficiency functions for algorithms, called \ii{asymptotic notation}; it's discussed at length in chapter 3.
