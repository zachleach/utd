\section{Give asymptotic upper and lower bounds for $T(n)$ in each recurrence. Assume $T(n)$ is constant for $n \leq 2$. Make bounds as tight as possible}
\begin{enumerate}[a.]
	\item $T(n) = 16	T(n/4) + n^2$
	\item $T(n) = 7		T(n/3) + n^2$
	\item $T(n) = 7		T(n/2) + n^2$
	\item $T(n) = 2		T(n/4) + n^2$
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{What are asymptotic upper and lower bounds?}
Asymptotic upper bound refers to $O(g_n)$ notation (e.g., $f_n \leq c \cdot g_n$). Asymptotic lower bound refers to $\Omega(g_n)$ notation (e.g., $f_n \geq c \cdot g_n$).

\subsection{How do you find the asymptotic upper and lower bound of a recurrence?}

\section{Prove the substitution method that the solution to the following recurrence is $S(n) = O(n\lg^2(n))$}
\begin{align*}
	S(n) &= 2S(n/2) + n \lg n \\
	S(1) &= 1
\end{align*}
