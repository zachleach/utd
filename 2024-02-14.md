The exam is on March 6th, calculator, open note, and every question is multiple choice. Content is, allegedly, heavily based on the lectures.

Frequency and time division multiplexing have an issue of signal overlap, resolved by guard bands and guard times (respectively). 

There are two types of switching, each has tradeoffs. Circuit switching is low latency, high predictability, but is complex to setup and doesn't scale well. Packet switching utilizes resources well, but requires packet header overhead, and has syncrhonization (packet loss) issues.

By definition, TDM sends packets in a set order. Receivers are physically setup to receive packets based on that order. TSI (time slot interchange) allows re-ordering of the packets sent over the physical medium before they are received, enabling higher flexibility for TDM.

Circuit switching has setup delay on the initial message. After the connection is setup, messages can be sent back and forth over the connection with no setup delay; each node reserved for the connection. This is in contrast to packet switching, where no nodes in the networks get reserved (better utilization of resources, but at the cost of transmission speed and overhead).

Packet switching has a notable advantage in terms of error resolution; namely, that errors received on the packet level, via packet switching, are much smaller than errors on the entire message, via cicuit switching, and therefore take much less time to resolve.
