#	Meeting 2024-02-29

This meeting we decided how to divide tasks to best complete project iteration one, two, and individual homework one. Specifically, we split the work into 6 fundamental categories and assigned each team member to one of them as follows:

| No.	| Task								| Person	|
| -		| -									| -			|
| 1.	|	Requirements gathering			|	Marley	|
| 2.	|	Use-case defining				|	Aziz	|
| 3.	|	Project code					|	Zach	|
| 4.	|	Presentation & GitHub			|	Estevan	|
| 5.	|	Domain classification diagrams	|	Jagger	|
| 6.	|	Use-case diagrams				|	Oleks	|

We identified the dependencies of each task: use-cases (Aziz) needs requirements (Marley), domain modeling (Jagger) needs requirements (Marley), use-case diagrams (Oleks) require use-cases (Aziz), and presentation formatting and GitHub needs requirements (Marley), use-cases (Aziz), and diagrams (Jagger, Oleks).

By dividing up the work this way, each person can do one thing at a very high quality rather than everyone doing everything at a very low quality. The main drawback of this approach is that the work can't be done asynchronously (e.g., one person must wait for another to finish before getting started).
