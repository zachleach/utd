an extension of the individual homework


# content

15	10 functional requirements		
5	requirements priority weight	
10	5 non-functional requirements	
5	traceability matrix				
5	5+ constraints					
10	brainstorming classification domain modeling	
10	high level and abstract use cases	
10	expanded use-cases with pre-post conditions
10	use-case diagram for each actor and use-case
5	traceability matrix for requirements and use-cases
15	wiki page organization

35	requirements
5	real world constraints
10	brainstorming classification domain modeling
35	use-cases
15	github wiki organization


how do we organize and combine everyone's homework 1 into one thing?


> what are functional requirements
