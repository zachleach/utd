\section[Problem 6]{Order the following functions such that $f_1 = \Omega(f_2), f_2 = \Omega(f_3), ..., f_{29} = \Omega(f_{30})$, and partition them into equivalence classes such that each function is big-$\Theta$ of each other.}

% create macro to convert list of functions into f_1 = \Omega(f_2), where f_1 is the function vertically above f_2 in the list of functions
