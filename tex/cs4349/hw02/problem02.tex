\section[Problem 2]{Use induction to prove $F_i = \frac{\phi^i - \hat{\phi}^i}{\sqrt{5}}$; where $F_i = F_{i-2} + F_{i-1}$, and $\phi$ is the golden ratio $\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}$.}

To prove by induction, write out the expressions $f_n$ and $f_{n + 1}$ (note: $f_{n + 1}$ is the same as $f_n$, but with $(n + 1)$ substituted everywhere in place of $n$). Trying to get the LHS of the expression $f_{n + 1}$ to equal the RHS of the expression in terms of $f_n$ is called the "inductive step". 

After the inductive step is complete, if the expression being proved $f_c$ also holds for some constant $c$, the expression is said to be "proved by induction".
