\section[Problem 2]{Use induction to prove $F_i = \frac{\phi^i - \hat{\phi}^i}{\sqrt{5}}$; where $F_i = F_{i-2} + F_{i-1}$, and $\phi$ is the golden ratio $\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}$.}

Proof by induction is used to show that an expression $f_n$ (typically a recursive function) is true; in practice, it is a two step process involving a calculation followed by a set of algebraic steps applied to the expression being proved. 

To prove by induction, write out the expressions $f_n$ and $f_{n + 1}$ (note: $f_{n + 1}$ is the same as $f_n$, but with $(n + 1)$ substituted everywhere in place of $n$). Next, write out $f_{n + 1}$ to have atleast one term equivalent to $f_n$. If you can transform the expression $f_{n + 1} = f_n + \dots$
