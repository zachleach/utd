\section[Problem 2]{Use induction to prove $F_i = \frac{\phi^i - \hat{\phi}^i}{\sqrt{5}}$; where $F_i = F_{i-2} + F_{i-1}$, and $\phi$ is the golden ratio $\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}$.}

Proof by induction is used to show that an expression (typically a recursive function) is true; in practice, it is a two step process involving a calculation and then a set of algebraic steps the expression to be proved. 

By demonstrating that $f_c$ is true for some constant $c$, and by demonstrating that $f_{n + 1}$ holds when using the function in terms of $n$
