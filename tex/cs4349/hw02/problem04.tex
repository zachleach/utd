\section[Problem 4]{Are either $2^{n + 1}$ or $2^{2n}$ big-$O$ of $2^n$?}

The former is, the latter is not. 

Suppose $2^{n + 1} = O(2^n)$, then $2 \cdot 2^n \leq c \cdot 2^n$ as $n \rightarrow \infty$; this is obviously true for all $c \geq 2$.  Regards to whether $2^{2n} = O(2^n)$, consider the inequality $2^{2n} \leq c \cdot 2^n$. This is equivalent to saying $2^n \cdot 2^n \leq c \cdot 2^n$. Dividing both sides by $2^n$ gives $2^n \leq c$, which is obviously false.
