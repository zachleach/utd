# Operating Systems: Exam 1

### 2024-02-08: start threads (ch 4)
Introduction to threads, and how they are different from threads. The key distinction is data sharing -- processes have distinct copies of data, whereas threads share a processes data. As a result, a lot of challenges arise.

### 2024-02-13 threads and concurrency
amdahls law is on the test
kernel threads, operating system threads, kthreadd
user threads, "invisible to the os"
servicing user threads (thread models)
many-to-one (uncommon), blocking issue
thread API handles the scheduling of user thread to kthread (not the os)
one-to-one (most common), resource intensive 
many-to-many (common), kthread multiplexing, two-level model
thread libraries (both user and kernel threads)
pthread interface (not implementation) pthread_attr_init(), pthread_create(), pthread_join(), pthread_exit()
java threads, extending thread, runnables, executor interface (java.util.concurrent
java thread pools, newSingleThreadExecutor(), newFixedThreatPool(int size), newCachedThreadPool()
fork join

java thread creation 
async thread cancellation
deferred cancellation

async signal sending
sync signal sending
thread cancellation modes
deferred kernel signal handler
user defined signal handlers
light weight processes (4.6.5)

Asynchronous thread cancellation deletes instantly, deferred cancellation sets a flag to indicate a thread *should* be terminated (allowing for safe termination). Threads being cancelled are called target threads. Asynchronous cancellation is useful primarily for terminating viruses, otherwise deferred should be used.

Signals are always sent to the process, not the thread. Only the parent process can send signals to its spawned threads. 

Processes have 4 options for signal handling: terminate the thread, terminate the entire process, terminate multiple threads.

Threads can generate signals, if the signal is sent to the parent process it's called "synchronous" signal sending; if it's sent to a different process, it's "asynchronous".

You can define signal handlers that can override the kernel's default signal handler.

Professor told story of how he was in charge of the hardware that would be utilized by virtual cloud type systems.
